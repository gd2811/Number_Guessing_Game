# Number Guessing Game

This repository contains a simple number guessing game implemented in Java. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess the number. With each guess, the player receives feedback indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, and it displays the number of attempts taken.

## How to Play

1. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The player is prompted to enter their guess.
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback:
   - "The number is higher. Guess again." if the guess is too low.
   - "The number is lower. Guess again." if the guess is too high.
4. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number, and the total number of attempts is displayed.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The core programming language used to develop the game.
- **Random Class:** For generating the random number.
- **Scanner Class:** For reading user input from the console.

## Future Enhancements

- **Difficulty Levels:** Introduce varying difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard) with different number ranges.
- **Score Tracking:** Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's performance over multiple games.
- **User Interface:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Add a multiplayer mode where two or more players can compete to guess the number.
- **Hint System:** Provide hints to the player after a certain number of incorrect guesses.
